== Overview

{product-name} supports using an Amazon S3 bucket as an endpoint to store
files.  The bucket can be in any region.  

{product-name} supports the following features on S3 endpoints:

* You may transfer files to and from S3 endpoints, as long as
the other side is an updated GridFTP server.  Transfers from an S3 endpoint to
another S3 endpoint are not supported.

* You may create ACLs on the endpoint to give other GO users
access to directories.   These ACLs are created and stored in {product-name},
not S3.

* Interactive directory listings

* Interactive directory creation (mkdir)

* Deleting files and directories

NOTE: A Managed Endpoint subscription is required in order to create S3
endpoints.  Please contact support@globus.org for more information. 

NOTE: Amazon S3 is an eventually-consistent system by design and {product-name}
can not guarantee stronger levels of consistency.
